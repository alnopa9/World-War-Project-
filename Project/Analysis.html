            For this project, our goal was to determine if there are any correlations between the different aspects of the wars, as well as the moral 
            of the troops. To successfully and effectively complete this task, our group read and analyzed letters that were written by troops throughout 
            the war. Our web page consists of a timeline of ten different war letters that were transcribed from images of the original, hand-written 
            letters for an easier read and comprehension. Each of the letters contain the date in which it was written, who the letter was written by,
            and a general title of each letter that briefly describes what types of situations the troops were facing. To view and read these letters, 
            click the ‘Letters’ tab at the top of the page to visit the section of the site where the transcriptions of each of the ten letters are held.
            There were a few different actions taken that were used in order to analyze the content of the letters, which can be found on the analysis page
            that can be reached by clicking on the ‘Analysis’ tab on our web page.
